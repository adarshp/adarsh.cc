I am a research scientist in the School of Information at the University of
Arizona. Broadly speaking, I am interested in machine learning and artificial
intelligence. In particular, I am interested in Bayesian generative approaches
to inference problems.

#### Current research
I am currently working on the automated assembly of executable causal models for
complex systems from textual evidence, as part of DARPA's Big Mechanism and
World Modelers programs.

I am a co-PI on the [AutoMATES](https://ml4ai.github.io/automates) project and
the primary developer of [Delphi](https://github.com/ml4ai/delphi), a
framework to automatically assemble causal, probabilistic model from machine
reading of textual evidence and formal analysis of source code structure.

## Teaching

Some of the courses I have taught in the past:

* [Methods in Experimental Physics (aka Advanced Lab)](/teaching/phys381/).
* [Introductory Algebra Based Physics (Lecture)](/teaching/phys102/)
* [Introductory Mechanics Lab](/teaching/phys141/)
* [Introductory Electricity and Mechanism Lab](/teaching/phys241/)

I also write about physics, programming, productivity and other random stuff
sometimes. You can find my previous posts [here](/notes/).
