I am a research scientist in the [School of
Information](https://ischool.arizona.edu) at the [University of
Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu). My research interests include the
development of [socially-aware AI teammates](https://ml4ai.github.io/tomcat),
and the automated assembly of executable causal models of complex systems from
[text](https://ml4ai.github.io/) and
[software](https://ml4ai.github.io/automates).

## Teaching

Some of the courses I have taught in the past:

* [Methods in Experimental Physics (aka Advanced Lab)](/teaching/phys381/).
* [Introductory Algebra Based Physics (Lecture)](/teaching/phys102/)
* [Introductory Mechanics Lab](/teaching/phys141/)
* [Introductory Electricity and Mechanism Lab](/teaching/phys241/)

I also write about physics, programming, productivity and other random stuff
sometimes. You can find my previous posts [here](/notes/).
