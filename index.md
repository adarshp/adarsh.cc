## Research
<hr class="featurette-divider">

Broadly speaking, I am interested in machine learning and artificial
intelligence. In particular, I am interested in Bayesian generative approaches.

## Teaching
<hr class="featurette-divider">

Some of the courses I have taught in the past:

* [Methods in Experimental Physics (aka Advanced Lab)](/teaching/phys381/).
* [Introductory Algebra Based Physics (Lecture)](/teaching/phys102/)
* [Introductory Mechanics Lab](/teaching/phys141/)
* [Introductory Electricity and Mechanism Lab](/teaching/phys241/)

I also write about physics, programming, productivity and other random stuff sometimes. You can find my previous posts [here](/archive.html).
