I am an Assistant Research Professor in the [School of
Information](https://ischool.arizona.edu) at the [University of
Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu). My research interests include
the development of [socially-aware AI teammates](https://ml4ai.github.io/tomcat),
and the automated assembly of executable causal models of complex systems from
[text](https://ml4ai.github.io/) and
[software](https://ml4ai.github.io/automates).
