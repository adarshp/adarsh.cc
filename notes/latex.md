My LaTeX Build System
========================

Over the years I've had to wrestle with the $\LaTeX$ typesetting system
a *lot*. Along the way, I've tried to automate and refine the build
process as much as possible, while including plots created with
matplotlib, pgf, etc. In this note, I attempt to describe this system in
the hope that it will be useful to others.

The tool that I use to track non-TeX file dependencies is none other
than the venerable [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). If
you are familiar with Makefiles and just want to see the the final
product, here it is:

```Makefile
all: main.pdf

plots := $(patsubst python_scripts/plots/%.py,\
                   build/plots/%.pdf,\
                   $(wildcard python_scripts/plots/*.py))

texfiles := $(patsubst python_scripts/texfiles/%.py,\
                    build/texfiles/%.tex,\
                  $(wildcard python_scripts/texfiles/*.py))

build/plots/%.pdf: python_scripts/plots/%.py $(wildcard data/*)
	mkdir -p build/plots
	python $< $@

build/texfiles/%.tex: python_scripts/texfiles/%.py $(wildcard data/*)
	mkdir -p build/texfiles
	python $< $@

main.pdf: main.tex $(plots) $(texfiles) bibliography.bib
	time ./latexrun --latex-cmd='lualatex' -O build \
	  --latex-args='-shell-escape' \
	  --bibtex-cmd='biber' -W no-overfull main.tex

```

In the following sections, I'll describe the directory structure, and
the logic behind the design of the Makefile. 

Directory structure
-------------------

This is what the directory structure of a typical TeX project of mine might look like:

```
.
├── README.md
├── Makefile
├── main.tex
├── bibliography.bib
├── data
│   └── data.tsv
├── latexrun
└── python_scripts
    ├── plots
    │   └── plotName.py
    └── texfiles
        └── tableName.py
```

- `README.md`: A basic README that explains the build prerequisites and
    how to compile the document (just type `make`!).
- `Makefile`: The Makefile above, that automates a lot of the dependency
    tracking.
- `main.tex`: The main TeX document to compile.
- `bibliography.bib`: The `.bib` file that holds the bibliography 
    information.
- `data`: The folder that holds the data to be processed, such as CSV 
       files, etc.
- [`latexrun`](https://github.com/aclements/latexrun): A modern wrapper
    around LaTeX that I like for the following reasons:
    - It's less verbose than
        [`latexmk`](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk?lang=en) (even with the `-quiet` flag).
    - The error messages are more helpful.
     And most importantly, I found that for large documents like my
     dissertation, continuously previewing `latexmk` did not quite work
     well with my PDF viewer of choice (for working with LaTeX at
     least), [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net). I should also note
     that I had multiple [TikZ](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/)
     diagrams in the document.
- `python_scripts`: This directory contains all the Python scripts used
    to generate plots and TeX files.
    - `plots`: Scripts for plotting with Python.
    - `texfiles`: Scripts for programmatically generating TeX files
        using Python. For example, we could analyse some data with the
        [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org) library and output a
        resulting table to LaTeX, or perhaps some symbolic mathematics
        using [Sympy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html).
    - It's important to note that each plot and each programmatically
    generated TeX file has its own individual script (for example
    `plotName.py` and `tableName.py`). I find that keeping things at
    this level of modularity seems to work best. It should also be noted
    that the name of the script should match the name of the plot or
    texfile to be generated, modulo the suffix. Thus, to include the
    plot generated by `plotName.py` and the table generated by
    `tableName.py` in my document, I would do something
    like:
    ```latex
    \includegraphics{build/plots/plotName.pdf}
    \input{build/texfiles/tableName}
    ```

Now that we have gone over the directory structure, let us look at the
structure of the Makefile.

Design of the Makefile
----------------------

Let us go through the Makefile, section by section.
The basic syntax for a Makefile rule looks like this:

```Makefile
target: dependency1 dependency2 ...
    recipe for building target
```

Let us take a look at the first line:

```Makefile
all: main.pdf
```
The target `all` represents the default target of the Makefile, that is,
what gets built if we just invoke `make` without any arguments. In this
case, we have specified the default target to be `main.pdf`.

Next, we define the Makefile variables `plots` and `texfiles`, defined below.

- `plots`: Makefile variable that collectively represents the plots
    in the document. (Note: to reference the variable, we need to
    enclose it within parentheses and prefix it with the dollar sign `$`.
- `texfiles`: Makefile variable that collectively represents the
    Python-generated TeX files that are included in the document.

To construct these variables, we use
[`wildcard`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Wildcard-Function)
to gather the names of the python scripts, and substituting either
`.pdf` or `.tex` for the suffixes, using
[`patsubst`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Text-Functions).


```Makefile
plots := $(patsubst python_scripts/plots/%.py,\
                   build/plots/%.pdf,\
                   $(wildcard python_scripts/plots/*.py))


texfiles := $(patsubst python_scripts/texfiles/%.py,\
                    build/texfiles/%.tex,\
                  $(wildcard python_scripts/texfiles/*.py))
```

We then specify the rules to build `plots` and `texfiles`. We specify the
contents of the `data` directory as dependencies, so that the plots and
tables will be rebuilt when the data changes. 

```Makefile
build/plots/%.pdf: python_scripts/plots/%.py $(wildcard data/*)
	mkdir -p build/plots
	python $< $@

build/texfiles/%.tex: python_scripts/texfiles/%.py $(wildcard data/*)
	mkdir -p build/texfiles
	python $< $@
```

Note that the rules includes making the directories `build`,
`build/plots`, and `build/texfiles`, if they do not already exist.
The last line of each rule makes use of the following automatic
variables:

- `$<`: The name of the first prerequisite.
- `$@`: The name of the target.

So, the line `python $< $@` translates to commands like: 

```bash
python python_scripts/plots/plotName.py build/plots/plotName.pdf
python python_scripts/texfiles/tableName.py build/texfiles/tableName.tex
```

Each Python script should accept one command line argument, which
is the name of the output file that it produces.

Finally, we specify how to build the PDF.

```Makefile
main.pdf: main.tex $(plots) $(texfiles) bibliography.bib
	time ./latexrun --latex-cmd='lualatex' -O build \
	  --latex-args='-shell-escape' \
	  --bibtex-cmd='biber' -W no-overfull main.tex
```

The target `main.pdf` depends on the the following.

- `bibliography.bib`: The bibliography for the document.
- `plots`, `texfiles`: See the definition of these Makefile variables above.

The recipe for building `main.pdf` involves calling the `latexrun` script,
(which I include in each project directory, so that my collaborators will
not have to hunt it down). I call it with the following options:

- `--latex-cmd='lualatex'`: My LaTeX compiler of choice. I like LuaLaTeX
    for its native support for Unicode, and for the ease of font selection.
- `-O build`: Set the output directory for the large number of auxiliary files
    produced by LaTeX, as well as the plots and TeX files produced by
    the Python scripts to the directory `build` (you can then simply add
    the `build` directory to your `.gitignore` file for easier version
    control with `git`).
- `--latex-args='-shell-escape'`: This option is mainly for using TikZ
    with the `externalize` library. It allows `lualatex` to create
    folders, etc.
- `bibtex-cmd='biber'`: Use
    [`biber`](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net) to process the
    `.bib` files. I use `biber` in conjunction with
    [`biblatex`](http://mirrors.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/entries/biblatex.html)
    to process the bibliography. 
- `-W no-overfull`: Get rid of annoying LaTeX warnings about overfull
    hboxes!



PGF/TikZ
--------

I like using TikZ and PGF to generate diagrams that match the native
look and feel of the document. To speed up document compilation when
you're using PGF and TikZ, you should use the `external` library. To
integrate with this build system, we specify the build directory name to
be the same as the one we used in the Makefile. The code snippet below
is what I put in my preamble to make this work.

```latex
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\usepgfplotslibrary{external}
\immediate\write18{mkdir -p build}
\tikzexternalize[prefix=build/]
```

Conclusion
----------

I hope you find this build system useful, especially for longer TeX
documents. I expect that I will continue to refine it even further in
the future - and I will update this page when that happens.
