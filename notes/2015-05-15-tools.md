Some of my tools.

Research
========

* [Zotero](www.zotero.org): Reference management.
* [Latexian](http://tacosw.com/latexian/): Real time previewing LaTeX editor. I try to maintain an electronic lab notebook with this.
* [LaTeXit](www.chachatelier.fr/latexit/): For high quality equations and Feynman diagrams to put in Keynote presentations.
* [Jaxodraw](jaxodraw.sourceforge.net/): For Feynman diagrams that are more complicated and would take a long time to perfect with `feynmp`.
* [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/): My favorite tool for creating presentations. Easily handles vector graphics, has nice suggested gridlines to snap to so that your visuals are nice and symmetric, super easy to use, nice transitions for those presentations when you don't have to go back through slides, export to PDF for when you have to upload your presentations beforehand on to windows computers, and oh, did I mention vector graphics?
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) - The package manager I use to keep everything working and linked properly on my Mac.

Organization
============

* [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus): My task manager. It's harder to use it for organizing research since research work can often be nebulous and take unexpected turns. It's not really effective to have a task like "Read X paper" in Omnifocus, since the paper might take multiple days to read and digest. I do use it for everything else - keeping in touch with friends and family, household tasks, and some of the more concrete grad school tasks like applying for grants, etc. For research work I usually try to write down in my electronic lab notebook (ELN) the main tasks for the day and how much time I estimate they will take. (Disclaimer: Well, I try, at least!)
* [Evernote](www.evernote.com): Great for jotting down notes quickly. (And daily agendas, for those days when Omnifocus seems a bit overwhelming, and also when I want to have a sequential list of tasks to do - Omnifocus doesn't allow me to manually drag and change the order of tasks.)

Website
=======

* I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to run this website. My first foray into making a personal website was with Apple's iWeb. It was a nice way to dip my toes in the water. However, I learned soon that the webpages so created were bloated, and besides, I was toying with the idea of having a blog (and still am!), so I switched to Wordpress. Folks claim it's superior for search engine optimization, but I have a *pretty* unique name, so I'm not too worried about not showing up in a Google search. This was fun, and I learned CSS by hacking the default Wordpress themes. However, it turned out that writing posts was kind of a chore - you would have to log in, and the entire framework was just too bulky, pages took too long to load, and so on. To make things faster, I coded a simple website for myself using just HTML and CSS, and deployed it on my department's server. This was pretty fun (and quite time consuming, if I may add) but at least my website was super fast and responsive. I learned about flat-file CMSes later but they did not quite work for me on my department's server. Finally I learned about Jekyll earlier this semester, but was a bit hesitant to give it a go. I'm glad I did, it's quite fast for prototyping websites, and creating websites with markdown instead of HTML is quite the improvement in quality of life!

p.s. If any fellow UA physics grads are wondering about how to make their own personal website, just do the following in a terminal:

	ssh username@physics.arizona.edu
	(enter your password)
	makehome

Your website is in the folder `public_html`. I got started with the [Poole](http://getpoole.com) template, and I recommend it highly.

* FTP client: [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) - A nice, free FTP client when I feel like browsing remote servers using a GUI.
