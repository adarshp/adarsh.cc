[Original paper on arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6287)

The authors argue that a mono-Z trigger will be more effective in finding electroweakinos than the more ubiquitous mono-jet and mono-photon triggers for mass differences between the LSP and NLSP in the range of 1 to 10 GeV. They contend that the mono-Z channel will have less standard model background at 13 TeV. They also present an effective operator analysis of the mono-photon process.
