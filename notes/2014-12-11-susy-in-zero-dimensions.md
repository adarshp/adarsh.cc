A cute result - how to get the quantum harmonic oscillator spectrum using supersymmetry. Basically an exposition of a result I found in *H.L. Cycon, R.G. Froese, W. Kirsch, and B. Simon, Schrodinger Operators (1987)*. This was the final project for the Mathematical Physics course that I took in Fall 2014.
