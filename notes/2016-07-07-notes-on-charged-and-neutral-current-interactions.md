In the vein of the [last post](2016-07-06-notes-on-electroweak-symmetry-breaking-and-the-higgs-mechanism.html), here are some of my old notes on charged and neutral current interactions in the standard model. As with the other notes, they reference 'Weak Interactions and Modern Particle Theory' by Howard Georgi, Peskin and Schroeder's 'An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory', and my advisor's lecture notes.
