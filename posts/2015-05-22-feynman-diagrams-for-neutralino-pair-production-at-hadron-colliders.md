Here are some hand-drawn Feynman diagrams for neutralino dark matter pair production at hadron colliders. Note that these diagrams do not take into account neutralino mixings (as in, you won't see a wino coupling to a higgsino, etc.) or electroweak symmetry breaking - the neutral higgsinos have not mixed with each other yet. The relevant vertices are also given.

These might come in handy if you are reading [Neutralino Dark Matter at 14 and 100 TeV](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0682).
