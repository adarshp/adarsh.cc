Introductory Electricity and Magnetism
======================================

Learning Objectives:

* See how the theoretical framework of electromagnetism that you learn in lecture plays out in the physical world.
* Gain hands-on experience with common E&M apparatus and techniques, including circuits, oscilloscopes, and other miscellaneous arcane devices. More importantly, to increase general experimental dexterity and intuition, and develop problem-solving skills.
* Learn to communicate scientific ideas effectively through writing.
