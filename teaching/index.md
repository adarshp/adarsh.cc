## Programming

I organized the IVILab summer programming bootcamp in the summers of 2017 and
2020. Here I share some of the materials I developed for the summer 2020
bootcamp.

## Physics

I was a teaching assistant for most of my time as a doctoral student. I was the
lab TA for numerous lab courses, as well as the lecturer for one summer course.
Below are links to materials I prepared for these courses.
