title: Index of Refraction of Gases
layout: page
---

There is a temperature correction that you can apply...usually values for
the index of refraction of gases are given assuming that the temperature of the 
gas is 0 degrees Celsius. Find this temperature correction and account for it. Use the temperature from the
thermometer next to the solar spectrum chart near the rear entrance of the lab.
