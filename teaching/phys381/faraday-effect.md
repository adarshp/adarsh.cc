## Faraday Effect

When polarized light passes through a material, changing the magnetic field in the material will change the angle of the plane of polarization of the light. This is known as the Faraday effect. Different materials respond differently to applied changes in magnetic field, and the quantity that characterizes this is known as the *Verdet Constant* , V, which you will measure for three different materials: extra dense flint, light flint, and acrylic.

Suggested plan for this experiment:

* Week 1: Make a calibration curve of magnetic field at the gap in the center of the electromagnet vs. the current passing through the coils, when there is no material in the gap. Once you put the material in there, you won't be able to directly measure the magnetic field using the magnetometer, so you will have to extrapolate what it must be from the reading of the electric current through the coils. (NB: The value of the auxiliary magnetic field *H* in Oersteds will be the same number as the magnetic field in Gauss, that you measure using the magnetometer(which actually reads the magnetic field in milliTesla (mT) - convert that to Gauss)) If you have time left, try to get auxiliary magnetic field versus angle of polarization data for one sample.
* At home, between weeks 1 and 2: Analyze your data to find the Verdet Constant for the sample  and see if your measured value is consistent with the accepted value.
* Week 2: Collect data for the other samples - take multiple datasets
* Between weeks 2 and 3: Learn about the theory, perform error propagation, see if your other datasets yield accurate values for the Verdet Constant
* Week 3: Collect final datasets, see if there is anything you can do to improve your data collection techniques.
* After week 3: Analyze final datasets, write final experiment summary.
