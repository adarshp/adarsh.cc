## General Tips

PROOFREAD! (Or get a friend and proofread each other's reports - this is better.) I recommend going to the Writing Center if English is not your first language and having them proofread your report.

## LaTeX Resources

$\LaTeX$ is a typesetting language that is widely used to typeset mathematical and scientific papers. You should learn to use it too. Unfortunately, installing it is a pain. Fortunately, you don't have to, if you don't want to - there are a couple of websites that do back-end LaTeX processing and display the result in your browser itself. I recommend [ShareLaTeX](www.sharelatex.com) or [Overleaf](www.overleaf.com).

To ease the process somewhat, I've uploaded a sample report (one that I did when I was taking your equivalent of Physics 382) along with its LaTeX source [here](/assets/sample_report/). You will need to download the .jpg image files as well if you want to compile the document.
