I've written up some tips and provided some resources for Advanced Lab - I hope you find them useful, and please don't hesitate to contact me with comments/corrections/additions.

- [Formal reports](formal_reports/)
- [Presentations](presentations/)
- [Interactive Error Analysis Tutorial in Python](error_analysis.html)
- [Hints for deriving the gas flushing equation for \\(C_p/C_v\\)](cp_cv.html)
- [Speed of Sound](speed-of-sound.html)
- [Vacuum procedure](vacuum.html)
- [Counting Statistics](counting_statistics.html) 
- **Range of $\alpha$ particles:** The formula for converting pressure into effective distance is:
$$d_{\mathrm{effective}} = \left(\frac{288d}{76 \mathrm{cm Hg}(T+273)}\right)$$
- **Big G: **There is a typo in question 24 - the correction should be 7.4% instead of 6.9%.
- **Skills labs: **In general, what I look for when I grade skills lab notebook entries is a detailed procedure, along with diagrams of the equipment, and also descriptions of any precautions to take or obstacles you might have faced while performing the skills lab.
- **Op Amps: **Detailed procedure, circuit diagrams. Also analyze the following circuits after the manner of the unity gain inverting amplifier: the summing amplifier, the difference amplifier, the inverting amplifier (of which the unity gain inverting amplifier is but a special case), and the level detector/comparator. For the integrator and differentiator circuits, the circuits provided in the lab writeup (the one that you actually build) are 'practical' differentiators and integrators. These are more difficult to analyze - instead, just analyze an 'ideal' differentiator and an 'ideal' integrator. You can find these described in many sources online.
