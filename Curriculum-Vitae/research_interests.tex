    The overarching theme of my research is the development of artificial
    intelligence techniques to accelerate the construction, curation, and
    evaluation of scientific models. I take a holistic approach to this goal,
    combining statistical and symbolic techniques with domain-specific
    knowledge to address a variety of research questions in the physical and
    social sciences.
