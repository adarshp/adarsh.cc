    abstract = "Building causal models of complicated phenomena such as food
    insecurity is currently a slow and labor-intensive manual process. In this
    paper, we introduce an approach that builds executable probabilistic models
    from raw, free text. The proposed approach is implemented through three
    systems: Eidos, INDRA, and Delphi. Eidos is an open-domain machine reading
    system designed to extract causal relations from natural language. It is
    rule-based, allowing for rapid domain transfer, customizability, and
    interpretability. INDRA aggregates multiple sources of causal information
    and performs assembly to create a coherent knowledge base and assess its
    reliability. This assembled knowledge serves as the starting point for
    modeling. Delphi is a modeling framework that assembles quantified causal
    fragments and their contexts into executable probabilistic models that
    respect the semantics of the original text, and can be used to support
    decision making.",
