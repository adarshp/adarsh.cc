Beyond simply capturing speaker switches, identifying how speakers interact with each other in a dialogue is crucial to understanding conversational flow. This becomes increasingly important and simultaneously difficult to model when more than two interlocutors take part in a conversation. To overcome this challenge, we propose to explicitly add speaker awareness to each utterance representation. To that end, we use a graph neural network to model how each speaker is behaving within the local context of a conversation. The speaker representations learned this way are then used to update their respective utterance representations. We experiment with both multiparticipant and dyadic conversations on the MRDA and SwDA datasets and show the effectiveness of our approach."

We further investigate the effectiveness of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms in modeling utterances and dialogs for DA classification. We achieve a substantial increase of 3 percentage points in the F1 score relative to current state-of-the-art models on two prominent DA classification datasets, MRDA and EMOTyDA.",

abstract="When performing complex tasks, humans naturally reason at multiple temporal and spatial resolutions simultaneously. We contend that for an artificially intelligent agent to effectively model human teammates, i.e., demonstrate computational theory of mind (ToM), it should do the same. In this paper, we present an approach for integrating high and low-resolution spatial and temporal information to predict human behavior in real time and evaluate it on data collected from human subjects performing simulated urban search and rescue (USAR) missions in a Minecraft-based environment. Our model composes neural networks for high and low-resolution feature extraction with a neural network for behavior prediction, with all three networks trained simultaneously. The high-resolution extractor encodes dynamically changing goals robustly by taking as input the Manhattan distance difference between the humans' Minecraft avatars and candidate goals in the environment for the latest few actions, computed from a high-resolution gridworld representation. In contrast, the low-resolution extractor encodes participants' historical behavior using a historical state matrix computed from a low-resolution graph representation. Through supervised learning, our model acquires a robust prior for human behavior prediction, and can effectively deal with long-term observations. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to approaches that only use high-resolution information.",

However, most of these are currently constructed manually, thus failing to take advantage of procedural content generation (PCG), a capability unique to virtual task environments. In this paper, we present mcg, an open-source library to facilitate implementing PCG algorithms for voxel-based environments such as Minecraft. The library is designed with human-machine teaming research in mind, and thus takes a `top-down' approach to generation, simultaneously generating low and high level machine-readable representations that are suitable for empirical research. These can be consumed by downstream AI applications that consider human spatial cognition. The benefits of this approach include rapid, scalable, and efficient development of virtual environments, the ability to control the statistics of the environment at a semantic level, and the ability to generate novel environments in response to player actions in real time.",

  Higgses, or a non-SM Higgs and a SM gauge boson, with branching fractions that
  quickly dominate those of the conventional decay modes to SM particles. In this
  study, we focus on the prospects of probing Type-II 2HDMs at the LHC and a

  prominent exotic decay channels: A {\textrightarrow} HZ, A {\textrightarrow}

  100-TeV pp collider can probe most of the region of the Type-II 2HDM parameter

  sizable exotic decay branching fraction through these channels, making them
  complementary to the conventional decay channels for heavy non-SM Higgses.",

        language utterances in real time, and publish them for consumption by

        of our rule-based event extraction system on a recently conducted ASIST
