    concepts and their descriptions is useful for a variety of tasks, ranging
    from mathematical information retrieval to increasing accessibility of
    scientific documents for the visually impaired. This entails segmenting
    mathematical formulae into identifiers and linking them to their natural
    language descriptions. We propose a rule-based approach for this task,
    which extracts LaTeX representations of formula identifiers and links them
    to their in-text descriptions, given only the original PDF and the location
    of the formula of interest. We also present a novel evaluation dataset for
    this task, as well as the tool used to create it.",

    insecurity is currently a slow and labor-intensive manual process. In this
    paper, we introduce an approach that builds executable probabilistic models
    from raw, free text. The proposed approach is implemented through three
    systems: Eidos, INDRA, and Delphi. Eidos is an open-domain machine reading
    system designed to extract causal relations from natural language. It is
    rule-based, allowing for rapid domain transfer, customizability, and
    interpretability. INDRA aggregates multiple sources of causal information
    and performs assembly to create a coherent knowledge base and assess its
    reliability. This assembled knowledge serves as the starting point for
    modeling. Delphi is a modeling framework that assembles quantified causal
    fragments and their contexts into executable probabilistic models that
    respect the semantics of the original text, and can be used to support
    decision making.",

  abstract="The exotic decay modes of non-Standard Model (SM) Higgses in models
  with extended Higgs sectors have the potential to serve as powerful search
  channels to explore the space of Two-Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs). Once
  kinematically allowed, heavy Higgses could decay into pairs of light non-SM
  Higgses, or a non-SM Higgs and a SM gauge boson, with branching fractions that
  quickly dominate those of the conventional decay modes to SM particles. In this
  study, we focus on the prospects of probing Type-II 2HDMs at the LHC and a
  future 100 TeV pp collider via exotic decay channels. We study the three
  prominent exotic decay channels: A {\textrightarrow} HZ, A {\textrightarrow}
  H{\textpm}Wâˆ“ and H{\textpm} {\textrightarrow} HW{\textpm}, and find that a
  100-TeV pp collider can probe most of the region of the Type-II 2HDM parameter
  space that survives current theoretical and experimental constraints with
  sizable exotic decay branching fraction through these channels, making them
  complementary to the conventional decay channels for heavy non-SM Higgses.",
